The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit usage. For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` works fine, but `width: calc(50% - 10);` will likely fail because `10` lacks a unit.  Another issue arises when combining different units within a single `calc()` expression without proper unit consistency.  This can also cause rendering errors.
